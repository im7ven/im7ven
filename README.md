<p align="left">I am a Frontend Developer specializing in TypeScript, React, and Next.Js. My expertise extends to popular React libraries, including React Query, React Hook Form, and Zustand for state management. While I have exposure to backend tools such as MongoDb, Node.js, and Prisma ORM, my current focus is on mastering the depths of frontend development.<br><br>At the moment, I am focusing more on quality and testing in every project with Vitest. <br><br>Feel free to check out my portfolio to see some of the projects I've worked on - https://justinalexanderv2.vercel.app</p>
